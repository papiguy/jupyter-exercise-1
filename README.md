# jupyter-exercise-1
This is a jupyter notebook I created because most of the examples are not documented in place and it becomes hard for someone to follow. You have to have a tutorial and python code in separate places. This calls out a summary and code all in one place. So in this sense this is a notebook with documentation and can be used to run live examples.
